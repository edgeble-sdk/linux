- *Neural Compute Modules:* NCM's are Compute or System On Modules (COM/SOM) built on top of High Performace, Ultra Vision AI Accelerators with on-module WiFi and Camera accessing for Edge AI-enabled solutions.

- *Open Source BSP:* Board Supported Packages delivers Boot firmware and Linux Kernel in the form Debian distribution via Debos and Embedded Rootfilesystems via Yocto/OE layers.

- *GPU/VPU/NPU:* Set of Open Source and closed acceleration tools for accessing Video, Graphics and Neural models to the user-space.

- *Pre-trained Model:* State-of-the-art pre-trained model management tools that delivers single API to access user-defined models. Single API has a built-in model conversion (NPU-based models to user-defined models) and optimization algorithms.

- *Update/Fleet:* Robust, Fast, Fail-safe secure deployment tools that are used to delover Continous Intigration and Delivery (CI/CD) to the NCM's via DevOps loop.
